# springboot_kafka_real_world_project

<p>I created two projects, one for kafka producer another for kafka consumer. 
Kafka producer project was created to implement kafka producer to read the real time stream data from the wikimedia
and write that data to the kafka topic 
and I have created kafka consumer project to consumer the real-time stream data from the kafka topic and write the data to the mysql database.</p><br/>
